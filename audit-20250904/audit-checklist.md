## 🚨 Critical Commands for Audit Week

### Emergency Compliance Check
```bash
# Quick compliance assessment
audithound audit . --framework soc2 --format json | jq '.compliance_percentage'
```

### Multi-Framework Analysis  
```bash
# Check against multiple frameworks
for framework in soc2 nist cis owasp; do
  echo "=== $framework ===="
  audithound audit . --framework $framework --format json | jq -r '.executive_summary'
done
```

### Evidence Package Generation
```bash
# Generate complete evidence package
mkdir audit-evidence-$(date +%Y%m%d)
cd audit-evidence-$(date +%Y%m%d)

audithound audit .. --framework soc2 --output soc2-report --format markdown
audithound audit .. --framework nist --output nist-report --format markdown  
audithound scan .. --output technical-scan --format json
audithound scanners --list-all > scanner-inventory.txt
```
