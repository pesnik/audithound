2. HIGH PRIORITY: Remediate 5 controls with high-severity findings within 30 days.
3. COMPLIANCE REMEDIATION: 4 controls are currently non-compliant. Develop remediation plans with defined timelines and responsible parties.
4. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines to prevent regression.
5. Establish regular security audit cycles (quarterly recommended).
6. Provide security training to development teams on secure coding practices.
7. Document all remediation efforts for audit trail purposes.
8. Consider engaging security consultants for complex compliance requirements.
